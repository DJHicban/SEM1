                <h2>Ateneo Secured their Final Four slot against ADU</h2>
                <p>Ateneo de Manila University restored its end-game pride on Saturday, grounding the low-flying Adamson University to secure a Final Four comeback in the 77th UAAP men&rsquo;s basketball tournament at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
                <p>Playing with more resolve and urgency, the  Eagles shot down the winless Falcons, 67-52, to book their tenth victory and the all-important Final Four spot after missing the post-season last year.</p>
                <p>But the Eagles, who ducked a last-second scare from University of the Philippines in their previous game, underscored their recovery with the greater task that lies ahead of them.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;Masaya at satisfied din but we agreed that we&rsquo;re going to go all the way this year. That&rsquo;s going to be a tremendous task for us but cliché as it may sound but if we really believe it I know we can do this,&rdquo; Ateneo coach Bo Perasol said.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still aiming for that Top 2 spots.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>With the win, the Eagles now climbed to 10-3, just half a game behind league-leader Far Eastern University (10-2), and gained more inside track for a twice-to-beat advantage heading into the Final Four wars.</p>
                <p>Nursing just a 23-19 edge, Ateneo opened the second quarter with an 8-0 run to make it an 11-point lead.</p>
                <p>Yet </p>
                <p>the Falcons</p>
                 quickly responded with their own 8-0 blitz capped by threes from Don Trollano and Christian Garcia to cut the deficit, 27-34. The Eagles then dropped a 10-4 bomb to re-establish a double-digit lead, 41-31, at the half.
                <p> </p>
                <p>Despite leading, the Eagles were not yet out of the woods as Adamson came within six on a Joseph Nalos fastbreak lay-up and Trollano&rsquo;s freethrows early in the third.</p>
                <p>However, Ateneo got a lucky break when the entire Adamson bench was slapped with a technical foul for improper decorum after contesting a Don Trollano whistle at the 9:01 mark of the period.</p>
                <p>The call broke Adamson&rsquo;s momentum as the Falcons went scoreless in the last 5:10 minutes of the game while the Eagles unleashed a 15-0 onslaught to erect their biggest lead at 56-35.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I really feel that our energy was waning. Thankfully our defense kicked in in the third and early fourth quarter,&rdquo; said Perasol, noting the Eagles&rsquo; tough three-game schedule in seven days.</p>
                <p>Kiefer Ravena led the Eagles with 16 points while Chris Newsome added 11.</p>
                <p>Trollano meanwhile scored 20 to pace Adamsdon, which dropped to 0-13.</p>
